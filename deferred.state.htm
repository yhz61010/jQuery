         <p>The deferred.state() method returns a string representing the current state of the Deferred object. The Deferred object can
            be in one of three states:
         </p>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               <strong>"pending"</strong>: The Deferred object is not yet in a completed state (neither "rejected" nor "resolved").
            </li>
            
            <li>
               <strong>"resolved"</strong>: The Deferred object is in the resolved state, meaning that either <code><a href="deferred.resolve.htm">
                     deferred.resolve()</a></code>
               or <code><a href="deferred.resolveWith.htm">
                     deferred.resolveWith()</a></code>
               has been called for the object and the doneCallbacks have been called (or are in the process of being called). 
            </li>
            
            <li>
               <strong>"rejected"</strong>: The Deferred object is in the rejected state, meaning that either <code><a href="deferred.reject.htm">
                     deferred.reject()</a></code>
               or <code><a href="deferred.rejectWith.htm">
                     deferred.rejectWith()</a></code>
               has been called for the object and the failCallbacks have been called (or are in the process of being called).
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         
         <p>This method is primarily useful for debugging to determine, for example, whether a Deferred has already been resolved even
            though you are inside code that intended to reject it.
