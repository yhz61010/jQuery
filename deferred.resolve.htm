         <p>When the Deferred is resolved, any doneCallbacks added by <code><a href="deferred.then.htm">
                  deferred.then</a></code>
            or <code><a href="deferred.done.htm">
                  deferred.done</a></code>
            are called. Callbacks are executed in the order they were added. Each callback is passed the <code>args</code> from the <code>.resolve()</code>. Any doneCallbacks added after the Deferred enters the resolved state are executed immediately when they are added, using
            the arguments that were passed to the <code>.resolve()</code> call.了解更多内容，请参见如下文档 <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/">延迟对象</a>.
