         <p>As of jQuery 1.7 this API has been deprecated; please use <code><a href="deferred.state.htm">
                  deferred.state()</a></code>
            instead.
         </p>
         
         <p>Returns <code>true</code> if the Deferred object is in the resolved state, meaning that either <code><a href="deferred.resolve.htm">
                  deferred.resolve()</a></code>
            or <code><a href="deferred.resolveWith.htm">
                  deferred.resolveWith()</a></code>
            has been called for the object and the doneCallbacks have been called (or are in the process of being called).
         </p>
         
         <p>Note that a Deferred object can be in one of three states: pending, resolved, or rejected; use <code><a href="deferred.isRejected.htm">
                  deferred.isRejected()</a></code>
            to determine whether the Deferred object is in the rejected state. These methods are primarily useful for debugging, for example
            to determine whether a Deferred has already been resolved even though you are inside code that intended to reject it.
